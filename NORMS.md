Our Project: a Python Flask web app

How it works:
1. The meeting creator goes to the when-to-meet website 
2. Our algorithm generates a random link (with a random token)
3. The meeting creator sends the link to their team
4. Each team member fills in their schedule
5. The information is sent to our database
6. Final available times are sent to meeting creator when requested

Possible Features: 
* ability to change inputted times depending on names
* list view can be improved to calendar view

Our Goals:
* good time management
* finish our project before Finals

Our Guidelines:
* meet when necessary outside of section
* finish tasks by your assigned deadline
* arrive on time to meetings
