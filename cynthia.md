My name is Cynthia Zhang and I'm a second year CS major. I'm from the Bay Area. 

Here are some ideas for our CS48 project:
* have an elegant UI with both a calendar and list view
* have a "next" button to ensure the user checks all of the available times if the party is scheduling over a series of weeks
* automatically generate a paragraph after finding all possible times to meet to ask members which time to decide on
    Example (possible spiel to send in a professional email): 
        Here are all of the available times:
            all Mondays 10:00 AM - 11:45 AM
            Thursday 1/10 12:00 PM - 2:30 PM
            Friday 1/11 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM
        Which time should we choose?
* ensure that the user has an efficient and easy-to-fill-out form when entering their available times
