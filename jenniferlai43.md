- I like playing roblox.
- Ideas:
    - Server generates a URL with a token as a query string
    - Meeting creator specifies time period desired for period
    - Meeting creator distributes the link to meetees
    - Other meetees enter in their own available times
    - Available times are stored in a database
    - Server sends back the best time to meet based on availability of meetees
